## ⚡ Fun Facts & Philosophy

- I love squeezing every unnecessary byte out of gigantic `node_modules` folders. Someone once said, “node_modules is heavier than a black hole” — challenge accepted!
- I enjoy modernizing tech stacks, upgrading dependencies, and automating away the boring parts.
- Building scalable systems, automating workflows, and solving tough algorithmic challenges is my jam. Always keen on learning new tech and tackling exciting problems!
